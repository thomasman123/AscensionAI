## üí° Examples of What to Dump

```
===== YOUR COPYWRITING PHILOSOPHY =====
I believe copy should feel like a conversation with your best friend who happens to be an expert. No jargon, no fluff, just straight talk about how this thing will make their life better.

Always lead with the transformation, not the method. People don't buy courses, they buy the person they'll become.

===== YOUR FRAMEWORKS & METHODOLOGIES =====
My BRIDGE Framework:
B - Biggest problem they face
R - Results they really want  
I - Introduce the solution
D - Demonstrate with proof
G - Give them the next step
E - Eliminate risk with guarantee

===== YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS =====
- Fear of missing out (FOMO) - but make it real, not fake
- Social proof - specific numbers and names
- Authority - position as the expert who's been there
- Scarcity - limited spots/time, not fake countdown timers
```

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Add your knowledge** to the `KNOWLEDGE_DUMP` section
2. **Save the file** - that's it!
3. **The AI automatically uses** everything you added in all copy generation
4. **Test it** by creating a funnel and see your style come through

## üìù Pro Tips

- **Use examples** - Show, don't just tell
- **Include failures** - What doesn't work is just as valuable
- **Keep updating** - Add new insights as you learn
- **Use your voice** - Write it like you talk
